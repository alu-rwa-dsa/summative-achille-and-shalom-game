DESCRIPTION:



1.What the project does:
application is called APPcontact and is a small application to save contacts, i.e. emails, phone number, and name of the person. In general, it plays the role of a sim card but the only difference is that we wanted to develop it for those who want to save their contacts and who are used to saving their contacts on google and forget their passwords.

2.Why the project is useful
The application is a success because we have achieved our goal of saving, deleting, or managing other actions. Our main objective was to be able to set up a backup app. The first step of our project has been validated but with the resources and some research, we would like to adapt this app to a system like windows that could be synchronized with the user's phone to allow automatic backup.

3.How users can get started with the project
For user participation, we need to have feedbacks to know the improvements and also the flaws of our application and we always take feedback to heart and consider it the success of our project.

4.Where users can get help with your project
The user can come back to us for help in a difficulty he may encounter in our App.

5.Who maintains and contributes to the proje
The project was conceived by the whole team, the contribution of the project comes from all sides of our team members, we set out to implement the backup as a project or at least the data backup. In every application or file form there is a backup or a deletion. In general the maintenance of this project depends on the members of the group. 

But the problem that we have on the programe is like we need to make a vizuale representation of the app and the how we can inclus the app on the application systeme like ANDROID ,IOS  OR WINDOWS.


In the file Appcontact you can see the implementation of the application and everthing that you need to know .

APP SOLUTION 

For the solution to our application we would like to have the support of a professional who can guide us through the application development process.
We think that the solution to our problem lies in the accompaniment of an expert in mobile app because our project is more focused in the mobile but we also want a documentation with steps that can guide us in a specific application of this kind of App.but we think that we can push the application in different orientation. 
But also with a lot of research we will be able to find how to solve but for the resolution of the minimal problems like the graphic representation we can use some modul like matplobib but at this level it is how to introduce this visual in the applications and we want to be able to the application in an international scale.
The only way to solve this problem is to work with an expert, which is most likely to be the case.
