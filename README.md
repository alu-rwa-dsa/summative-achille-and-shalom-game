1.What the project does:
application is called APPcontact and is a small application to save contacts, i.e. emails, phone number, and name of the person. In general, it plays the role of a sim card but the only difference is that we wanted to develop it for those who want to save their contacts and who are used to saving their contacts on google and forget their passwords.

2.Why the project is useful
The application is a success because we have achieved our goal of saving, deleting, or managing other actions. Our main objective was to be able to set up a backup app. The first step of our project has been validated but with the resources and some research, we would like to adapt this app to a system like windows that could be synchronized with the user's phone to allow automatic backup.

3.How users can get started with the project
For user participation, we need to have feedbacks to know the improvements and also the flaws of our application and we always take feedback to heart and consider it the success of our project.

4.Where users can get help with your project
The user can come back to us for help in a difficulty he may encounter in our App.

5.Who maintains and contributes to the project
