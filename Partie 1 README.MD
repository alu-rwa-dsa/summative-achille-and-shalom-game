# PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Our project is focused on the backup as any kind of application for example Drive or google photos, but in a first time we launched our application only on the backup of contacts or different modes of communication.our Application is like a directory as google Drive but the first step will be to save the contacts and then the development will be done in the management of photos, videos ie all multimedia files. In general our application is focus on the management of the contact(delete,add,view).


# I-DATA USE:

For the data we want to use :
# 1. Array : 
# Traverse:
Go through the elements and print them.
# Search:
Search for an element in the array. You can search the element by its value or its index

# 2.Queue operations
#Given below are the 2 basic operations that can be performed on a queue. Please refer to Figure 4 to get a better understanding of the queue operations.
# Enqueue:
Insert an element to the end of the queue.
# Dequeue:
Delete the element from the beginning of the queue.

# 3.Linked list operations
# Search: 
Find the first element with the key k in the given linked list by a simple linear search and returns a pointer to this element
# Insert: 
Insert a key to the linked list. An insertion can be done in 3 different ways; insert at the beginning of the list, insert at the end of the list and insert in the middle of the list.
# Delete:
Removes an element x from a given linked list. You cannot delete a node by a single step. A deletion can be done in 3 different ways; delete from the beginning of the list, delete from the end of the list and delete from the middle of the list.

# II-ALGORITHME USE :


# MOTIVATION:

The motivation of this project is like we need to explore more about the stocking like on the video game or make more exploration in Big data for the future job.
but excepted we imagine that we can maybe develop the server that is maybe necessary for the new exploitation system like on the future Africa can have his server like google drive or google photos to save the data and like the future system and information form Africa can be saved there.So now we are in the first step of the process we need to explore more detail and  how we can update the application on maybe the new system .
